This is my config for emacs 24 running on OSX.  I barely know what I am doing when it comes to emacs, but I do know this setup includes the following packages:

1. js2-mode
2. web-mode
3. js REPL
4. jslint
5. magit

This directory needs some cleaning up, some things are not really being used anymore.  Hell I don't even know why I have jade-mode on here, and multi-web-mode seems like it can be replaced by web-mode for what I need it for.
